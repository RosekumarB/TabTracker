# TabTracker
TabTracker is a full stack web application developed using nodejs &amp; mysql in the backend and react on the frontend. 

This is actually a cloned version of the same app which was built using Vue.js library in the frontend by Cody Seibert from freecodecamp. 

Here is a link to the original tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4cRMaTDUI

The goal of redoing this project was to put together all the things I have learned while following various different courses on react and nodejs on the Internet. This app has a fairly better complexity than a simple To-do app and act as a good exercise to practise the skills learned.
